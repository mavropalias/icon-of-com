Are you curious to know what happened in 2019 in the React world, that you should know about?

I watch _a lot_ of dev conference talks. They're a great way to learn new things and stay up-to-date in my career as a developer.

In 2019, there were 23 React conferences—with ~500 talks (~180 hours)—and I covered all of them, on [Hero35](https://hero35.com).

The following talks are the ones that I enjoyed the most, due to their fascinating content and/or high educational value, captivating delivery, and clear audio quality. I added a short description on each one.

They're sorted chronologically (newest first).
