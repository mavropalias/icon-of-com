In a video about new ways to design natural user interfaces, Bill Buxton, principal researcher for Microsoft Research, explains how engineers can use a combination of interactive gestures and communication methods to enable a society of appliances to assist users of technology.

> "It's not about speech, it's not about gesture, it's not even about the phone, and it's not about human-to-human communication"

> "How these things work together in a natural and seamless way that reduces complexity for the usersâ€”that's what we're about. Getting these things right opens up another dimension in how we have technology integrated into our lives."
